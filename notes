What is the one task Netpowder can excel at and provide an actual quantum of
utility?

It's both a client and a server. What are Heroku and Codepen/JSFiddle missing?

Some metrics that might be useful:
- How few steps/commands must you type to accomplish task X?
- How robust is it? (how much does it fail?)

No or very little implicit scope.
