- BUG: Writing `open foo/bar` without foo being a directory fails silently.

- TODO: `open` should automatically do `shell mkdir -p` first.

- BUG: If you save a file `foo` and then create a directory `foo` it fails
  silently. Super hacky workaround: run `shell rm -r foo` to remove
  file/directory foo. Be careful not to remove anything else.

- FIXME: Remove switch statement, replace with something like
  http://ericleads.com/2012/12/switch-case-considered-harmful/ (this will bite
  you sooner or later)

- TODO: When we get return from save, it should preview (if it makes sense).
  This requires a better protocol in terms of state, I believe.

- BUG / KNOWN ISSUE: When input stops just short of a newline, for example with
  pkg install commands, the last message isn't printed

- TODO: Fix pong message to heartbeat with no reply, too spammy atm

- TODO: Debug ws network perf with wireshark, noticed readme slow. Good post
  too.  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3925118/how-to-debug-websockets

- TODO: netpowder-update script to update client based on this repo

- FIXME: var in declarations, better elem naming?
- TODO: Show preview info (file / link)
